## Feature Ideas

The list below is a list of **potential** _features_ or _enhancements_.
These might be entirely **new features** or **enhancements** to existing features.

They may, or may not, end up being added into _Extensibility Logs_.

- [x] Activity Log
- [x] Diagnostic Log
- [x] Path Variables
- [ ] VSIX Installer Log
- [x] MEF Error Log
- [ ] Service Hub Log

## Contributions

If you'd like to implement one of the _feature ideas_,
feel free to [open an _Issue_ on GitHub][github-issue-fi] (with the same name as the feature),
and we can start a discussion there.

We can then work toward developing a pull request,
so the your feature can be incorporated into _Extensibility Logs_.

Don't forget to check out the [Contribution Guidelines][contribution-guidelines].
