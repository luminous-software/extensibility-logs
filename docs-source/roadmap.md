## Feature Ideas

The list below is a list of **potential** _features_ or _enhancements_ (aka _FI's_).
These might be entirely **new features** or **enhancements to existing features**.
They may, or may not, end up being added into _Time Savers_.

- [ ] Duplicate File (one operation, instead of copy/paste/rename)
- [ ] Copy Solution (copy the entire solution, with a new name)
- [ ] Delete Solution (delete the folder containing the solution)
- [ ] Reload Solution (last solution - ie first in MRU list)
- [ ] Copy Project (one operation, instead of copy/paste/rename)
- [ ] Delete Project (one operation, instead of remove/open folder/delete)
- [ ] Reload Project (one operation, instead of unload/reload)
- [ ] Edit Path Variables
- [ ] Edit Environment Variables
- [ ] Clean Experimental Hive (as in [_Clean Hive and Debug for Extension Developers_][clean-hive-and-debug] - John McBride)

## Contributions

If you'd like to implement one of the the _FI's_ from the _feature backlog_,
feel free to [open an _Issue_ on GitHub][github-issue-fi] (with the same name as the feature),
and we can start a discussion there. We can then work toward developing a pull request,
so the implemented feature can be incorporated into *Time Savers*.

Don't forget to check out the [Contribution Guidelines][contribution-guidelines].

## Beta Features

_Beta features_ are _FI's_ that have actually had code written for them,
and are waiting for that code to be thoroughly tested.
You can participate in the testing phase by downloading the _CI build_.
You can install it on your own machine, and confirm that it does what it's supposed to do.
If you do find a problem, you can create a [Bug Report on GitHub][github-issue-bug-report].

Once they've passed testing they'll be included in the **next public release** of _Time Savers_.

>There are no beta features that need testing at the moment

## Bug Fixes

Once bug fixes have been fully tested, they'll be included in the *next public release*.

## Continuous Integration

The CI build is the build from the continous integration process.
The resultant VSIX file is then uploaded to the [VSIX Gallery][vsix-gallery] for you to download.

![(Build status)][appveyor-status]

If both build badges above are green, the latest CI build is ready to be downloaded and installed  to test.
